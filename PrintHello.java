     *  Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.
     * 
     *  The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving
     *  the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
     * 
     *  A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
     * 
     *  Every Java program has a class name which must match the filename.
     *  
     *  Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
     * 
     *  Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
     * 
     *  main()==> Every program must contain the main() method.
     * 
     *  System ==>System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members,
     *               such as out, which is short for "output".
     * 
     *  println ==> The println() method, short for "print line", is used to
     *               print a value to the screen.
     * 
     *  There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
     *  The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:     
     * 
     *  You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
